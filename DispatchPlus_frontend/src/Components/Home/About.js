                         Dispatch+ delivery drones are advanced flying devices that can carry
                         items (up to 5 lb.) within 1.5-mile radius around the device stations. Our delivery drones can reach an attitude
                         of 300 ft to avoid city traffic.

                         Dispatch+ delivery robots move at pedestrian speed and can carry items (up to 20 lb.)
                         within 1.5-mile radius around the device stations. Our delivery robots are extremely safe that can
                         avoid collisions with people and navigate around obstacles.
